            Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to find out a little more about me. 
            My name is Steven (most call me Steve) and I'm presently based in London (UK). I'm 26 years 
            old, a lover of everything tech, music, and art. In late 2019 I left the stability of my 
            job in pursuit of doing something more meaningful with my life. Following my resignation, 
            I taught myself OOP principles, attended Makers academy, and immersed myself in learning.

            I'm a musician, a horror movie nerd, and enjoy watching documentaries and most things animated.
            I'm not a huge sports fan but I love swimming and was a voluntary swimming teacher once upon a 
            time. I suppose you could say I'm a quirky individual, I embrace alternative culture and have 
            a taste for gothic fashion and Prog-Metal. I enjoy having conversations with those who think a 
            little different, but the world would be a boring place if we were all the same right?
