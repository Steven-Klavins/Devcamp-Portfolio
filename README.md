# Devcamp Portfolio 

## About
This repo has been created to document my progress on the [Dissecting Ruby on Rails 5 course](https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-rails-5-development-course/).

Despite the course being based on rails 5, I built this application in Rails 6 with a modernized approach. I took the course as a refresher on the framework to accommodate my new job role. Regardless of its age the course still covers a mountain of useful information regarding best practices and the Rails ecosystem.

## Course completion: 70%
