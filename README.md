## About
This repo has been created to document my progress on the [Dissecting Ruby on Rails 5 course](https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-rails-5-development-course/).

Despite the course being based on rails 5, I built this application in Rails 6 with a modernized approach. I took the course as a refresher on the framework to accommodate my new job role. Regardless of its age the course still covers a mountain of useful information regarding best practices and the Rails ecosystem.

## Deployment
Deployment of the app was done via Heroku, using the [Redistogo addon](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/redistogo).

## How to run 

### Note
The following environment variables will need to be added to aÂ .env file in the projects root directory, the project requires an AWS S3 bucket and Twitter API keys.
For more information on how to generate your own keys visit:

[Twitter API Docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

[AWS S3 Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html)

Your .env will need to be formatted as follows:

```
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_REGION=your-region-#

TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

```

Your cable.yml file will need the production URL changed to the following if your running the project locally. 

``` 
<%= ENV.fetch("REDIS_URL") { "redis://localhost:6379/1" } %> 
```

**Before running the project ensure you run** 

```
rails db:setup
```
**Followed by**

```
bundle install 
```
**Run any pending migrations with**

```
rails db:migrate 
```
**Optionally run**

```
rails db:seed 
```

**Install Yarn dependencies**

```
yarn install
```

**Finally run** 
```
rails s
```

## Testing 
Testing for models has been added using [RSpec](https://rspec.info/), these can be found in the spec directory.

**To run tests use**
```
bundle exec rspec
```
For [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) feature tests to run ensure your system has Google Chrome installed, alternatively update Capybara's default driver to use one of your choosing. This can be done in the feature test specs found in the [spec/features directory.](https://github.com/Steven-Klavins/Devcamp-Portfolio/tree/main/spec/features)
